**Unit 5: Art and the Public Sphere** <span id="5"></span> 
*The term “public sphere” is used to describe different public spaces,
not necessarily physical spaces, where people can congregate freely to
discuss and form their opinions. Art museums, galleries, cities, and
city plazas but also the media are some examples of the public sphere.
In the late 1980s, many artists became increasingly concerned with the
commercialization of the public sphere, which they felt threatened the
arts and impeded people to think freely and make their own decisions.  
  
 As a result, a number of artists examined the role of museums and the
way they represented or plainly misrepresented the public interest they
were supposed to serve. This type of artistic practice is called “the
institutional critique.” Other artists addressed the perils of
gentrification and the way city centers or entire cities lost their
public when people were forcibly evacuated or simply could not afford
the rent anymore, creating a series of works that is often identified as
“public art.” Most importantly, all these developments took place
against the backdrop of the so-called “culture wars” in America, when a
set of events and exhibitions, such as the Robert Mapplethorpe
exhibition or Richard Serra’s public sculpture Tilted Arc, resulted in a
heated debate and a very hostile environment for the arts, threatening
their survival and forever changing the art world.
