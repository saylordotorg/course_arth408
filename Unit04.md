**Unit 4: Postmodernist Rhetoric: Return to Painting and Object or
Further Questioning?** <span id="4"></span> 
*With an increasing presence of technology and shifting global
borders—promising and threatening—the 1980s were complex period in the
history of the 20th century, which for many in the West announced the
arrival of the postmodern, where* *many aspects of Modern art and
theory—such as the idea of linear progression together with the concepts
of originality and authenticity—were obsolete.  However, for many
cultural theoreticians and artists alike working at that time, this
fascination with the alleged end of modernism only proved its ongoing
pertinence. * *As a result, a vivid debate ensued—often referred to as a
“postmodernist rhetoric” in order to emphasize its polemical
character. *  
    
 *This debate divided the art world roughly into two camps: On one hand
were the artists who engaged in irreverent and often ironical
appropriation of past artistic styles, bringing back the dominance of
painting and sculpture, and on the other hand were those who used new
media and photography to question some of the basic assumptions of
modernist orthodoxy, such as the issues of originality and
authenticity.  In this unit, we will examine both camps, hoping to get a
clearer understanding of the main characteristics of this debate.*
