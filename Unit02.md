**Unit 2: Contesting Modernism: Art Beyond Painting and Sculpture**
<span id="2"></span> 

*In this unit, we will focus on a series of mostly international and
collective art practices that would trigger a powerful contestation of
modernist canon and challenge of its most important principles as
encapsulated by Greenberg’s writings and growing pressure of the art
market.  It was not an accident that most of the artists were very
young, bringing a sense of intensity and irreverence to the artistic
practice. We will start this unit by examining the ideas of the Parisian
collective known as the Situationist International (Situationists),
whose work addressed the nature and function of art and culture in
contemporary society, thus moving away from purely artistic issues. *

 

*We will continue by looking at the work of another international group
of artists who called themselves “Fluxus” (Flux).  We will study their
strategies and examine the ways in which they challenged the modernist
canon and the formalist definition of art as a visual “object” (i.e.,
painting or sculpture), introducing pluralism of expression involving
music, performance, and design.  We will continue our examination with a
series of experimental artistic practices associated with Lucy Lippard’s
influential publication Six Years: The Dematerialization of the Art
Object from 1966 to 1972, where she presented a documentation of
“so-called conceptual or information or idea art with mentions of such
vaguely designated areas as minimal, anti-form, systems, earth, or
process art,” summarizing some of the most important artistic
explorations at that time.*
