**Unit 3: Expanding Fields and Contesting Stereotypes** <span
id="3"></span> 
*Following the women’s liberation movement (second-wave feminism) coming
on the heels of the civil rights movement and many other liberation and
antiwar movements across the globe, many contemporary artists engaged
more openly with social issues. In this unit, we will discuss and
examine the ways in which contemporary artists associated with feminism
used their art as a tool to protest cultural myths and stereotypes. Some
of these works challenged preconceived notions of femininity and/or
race; the others were focusing on what artists perceived to be isolation
and disconnectedness in contemporary world. However, all of them were
interested in creating a thought-provoking situation that challenged the
viewer. Finally, we will explore how the use of loosely structured,
theater-like events—collectively called “performance art”—offered an
opportunity to create an interactive, socially responsive work of art,
thus making it, in the 1970s, a preferred form of expression for
feminists—and not only just them.*
