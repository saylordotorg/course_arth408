**Unit 1: Modernism in the Sixties** <span id="1"></span> 
*In this unit, we will start by exploring the New York art scene and
looking at why a majority of artists and the general public came to feel
distanced from modernism in the 1960s, perceiving it as a reductive
artistic style completely removed from life.  In order to understand
this change, we will examine broadly the context by looking into the way
the Cold War’s ideological battle had come to use modernist art as a
propaganda tool, why the term “white cube” was related to the Museum of
Modern Art in New York, and what was happening with the art market at
that time.  
  
 In the second part, we will continue by exploring the modernist canon
in the 1960s by looking at the work of the American art critic Clement
Greenberg and his definition of formalism (Greenbergian formalism).  We
will continue by analyzing post-painterly abstraction, one of the
movements Greenberg advocated in the 1960s, concluding with the work of
Helen Frankenthaler, an artist associated with this movement.  *
