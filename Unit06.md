**Unit 6: Narrating Identity** <span id="6"></span> 
*1989 was a watershed year. For many, the fall of the Berlin Wall
symbolized the end of the Cold War and a final victory of capitalism,
which had global consequences and created a big change in the way we
live and think about ourselves. Therefore, in the 1990s, contemporary
artists increasingly moved away from big social issues and turned their
focus to questions of identity, memory, and sexuality. Working as
anthropologists would do, the artists explored what it means to be a man
or a woman in a global world today: What is the role of memory and
sexuality in construction of identity? Furthermore, what does race mean
in today’s postcolonial world? Finally, what does it mean to be a human
in a world saturated by technology?  
  
 In this unit, we will explore a number of artworks built around such
questions. Importantly, most of these artists were addressing the issue
of identity by creating so-called “installation” work—or works of art
that engage the entire space of a gallery or exhibition, forcing the
viewer to respond with his or her whole body. Some artists create an
installation by making different objects, such as sculptures, and the
others would use old toys, stuffed animals, and similar objects. The
installation is for many contemporary artists an important feature
because it communicates with the viewer in a more direct way and as such
is more conducible in telling stories or narrating identities.
