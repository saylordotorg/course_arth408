In common conversation, we often use the phrase “contemporary art” to
refer to current artistic production—the art being produced today. 
However, in the art history field, the phrase denotes a specific period
of art and artistic practice starting in the 1960s and continuing
today.  It is characterized by a break from the modernist artistic canon
and a desire to move away from the dominant Western cultural model,
looking for inspiration in everyday and popular culture.  More
specifically, many contemporary artworks reject traditional modernistic
artistic media (such as painting or sculpture) in favor of a more
collaborative, ephemeral, and multimedia approach that further blurs the
boundaries between high and mass culture.  In its subject matter, this
art also tends to reflect a shift away from purely aesthetic issues to
more socially oriented concerns.  Finally, it is important to note that
contemporary art should not be seen as a progression of different
artistic styles but as series of different cultural, social, and
political inquiries that occupied contemporary art practice over the
course of the past 50 years or so.  We will examine these important
aesthetic and cultural changes within their historical and social
context as we progress through this course. This course will survey
contemporary art, starting with the 1960s and concluding in 2010.  While
the focus is on Western art and culture, we will also explore a
selection of contemporary art and artistic practices around the globe,
which have become increasingly influential in the definition of
contemporary art today.  Each of the units will examine a set of
specific aesthetic and social issues and look at the different
strategies contemporary artists proposed and used in their work.  By the
end of this course, you should be able to recognize and interpret most
important aspects of contemporary art and contemporary visual culture
while better understanding some of the cultural and social aspects of
our daily life in today’s global world.

these time advisories and determine how much time you have over the next
few weeks to complete each unit and then set goals for yourself.  For
example, Unit 1 should take you approximately 14 hours.  Perhaps you can
sit down with your calendar and decide to complete subunit 1.1 (4 hours)
on Monday night; subunit 1.2 (5 hours) on Tuesday night; etc.
